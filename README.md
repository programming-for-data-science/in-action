# _In Action_ Sections
These sections take a data driven approach to understanding issues such as gentrification, investment in education, and variation in life expectancy around the world. In doing so, they demonstrate how to use programming skills to ask real data science questions about pressing topic areas. These include:

- [**Flight Delays**](/dplyr): The _`dplyr` In Action_ section uses the `dplyr` package to explore the `nycflights13` data set, asking targetting questions about the 300,000+ flights that departed from New York City airports in 2013. 
- [**Exploring Educational Statistics**](/tidyr): The _`tidyr` In Action_ section uses the `tidyr` package to explore variations in educational investment and attainment around the world using data from the World Bank. 
- [**Finding Cuban Food in Seattle**](/apis): The _APIS In Action_ section uses the Yelp and Google Maps APIs to build a map of the highest rated Cuban Restaurants (in Seattle) on Yelp.
- [**Mapping Evictions in San Francisco**](/ggplot2): The _`ggplot2` In Action_ section uses the `ggplot2` package to expose the intensity and distribution of evictions in the city of San Francisco.
- [**Visualizing Building Permits in Seattle**](/interacitve-vis): The _Interactive Visualization In Action_ section uses various interactive visualization packages to explore new building permits in Seattle since 2010.
